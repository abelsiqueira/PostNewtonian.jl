# PostNewtonian

This package computes orbital dynamics of and waveforms from binary black-hole
systems, in the [post-Newtonian
approximation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-Newtonian_expansion).
Currently, there is no support for eccentric systems, but general precessing
quasicircular systems are supported.
